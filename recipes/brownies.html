    <h1>Brownies</h1>
    <img src="../images/brownies.jpg">
    <p>These are fudgy, gooey brownies made from scratch. The best part is the simple ingredients this recipe uses.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>10 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups granulated sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 plus 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/4 rounded teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2 large cold egg</li>
        <li>1/2 cup all purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Position an oven rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 325 degrees F. Line the bottom and sides of an 8-inch x 8-inch square baking pan with parchment paper or aluminum foil, leaving an overhang on opposite sides to help remove the baked brownies from the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Prepare a double-boiler by filling a medium saucepan with water about 2 inches deep. Heat the water until barely simmering.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the butter, sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a medium heat-safe bowl. Rest the bowl over the simmering water. If the bottom of the bowl touches the water, remove a little water from the saucepan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir the mixture occasionally until the butter has melted and the mixture is quite warm. Donâ€™t worry if it looks gritty; it will become smooth once you add the eggs and flour.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the bowl from the saucepan, and set aside for 5 minutes or until it is only warm, not hot.

        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the vanilla.
        </li>
        <li>Add the eggs, one at time, stirring vigorously after each one.</li>
        <li>
            When the batter looks thick and well blended, add the flour. Use a spoon to beat the flour into the batter until it is very thick and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. We use a wooden spoon or spatula and beat for 40 to 50 strokes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake the brownies until the edges look dry and the middle looks slightly underbaked; 20 to 30 minutes. You can test doneness by inserting a toothpick into the center. The brownies are finished baking if it comes out with a few moist crumbs attached.
        </li>
        <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
    </ol>
